    "# Homework: Understanding Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO NOT FORGET!** The purpose of the homework is to reinforce concepts from the unit through practice and help you to become a better programmer and computational thinker. There are dozens of methods for performing sentiment analysis and all of them are better than this one... but then again this assignment really isn't about sentiment analysis! ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine the mood of text, classified as positive, negative or neutral.  It has practical applications for analyzing reactions in social media, customer relationship managment,  comments / reviews, feedback and much more. For more information, see: [https://monkeylearn.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-examples/](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/sentiment-analysis-examples/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment we will create a very basic sentiment analyzer that scores each word of the input text as positive `+1`, neutral `0`, or negative `-1`. The sum of all the words in the text becomes the sentiment score. Text with an overall score `>0` will be considered positive, likewise text will an overall score of `<0` will be considered negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's up to you to create the initial list of words you consider positive or negative. You will not need many to test your program. For inspiration of words you can use, consult:\n",

    "    Input Positive Words: happy joy fun\n",
    "    Input Negative Words: angry sad mad\n",
    "    Input Text to Analyze: Carlos was a happy lad.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will complete this program in several phases, using the problem simplification approach similar the last to homework assignemnts. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Code 2.1** Write a function, `score_sentiment()` which given 3 inputs: positive words, negative words and some text, will return an integer score of sentiment as output. Assume all inputs are lower case and do not have any punctuations. You will write this function blind - meaning you will not know whether it is actually working until You Code 2.2\n",
    "- **You Code 2.2** Write a function `test_score_sentiment()` similar to the other test functions we have written and used in this course so far.  The function should take inputs for `score_sentiment()` along with an `expected` value, it should compute the `actual` value by calling `score_sentiment()` and then print the values, and `assert expected == actual`  \n",
    "Write at least 3 tests for this function to produce an expected score of +2, -2 and 0 respectively.\n",
    "-  **You Code 2.3** Write the main program using `input()` and `print()` functions. In this step you will copy in your `clean()` function from Small Group handle punctuation and lower-cased letters.\n",
    "- **You Code 2.4** Re-write the main program to use `IPWidgets` and the `@interact_manual` decorator to auto-create the input widgets. \n",
