    "# E2 Exam 3\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exams are high-stakes, summative assessments. \n",
    "- They measure the individual’s ability to recall, understand, and apply the course material. \n",
    "- They are one of two instruments in this course which measures your mastery of the learning outcomes.\n",
    "- **This exam 3 of 4**\n",
    "- All exams together total 90 points of the 256 that make up your grade in the course ~ 35% of your grade.\n",
    "- **You will have 25 minutes to complete 22 exam questions**.\n",
    "- Exam will be on paper: you will not need a computer to complete the exam.\n",
    "- Each exam focuses on specific lessons, but due to the nature of the course material, all exams are cumulative.\n",
    "- Exams are closed book. No use of notes, Jupyterhub, or any outside resources.\n",
    "- Students can bring a one page cheat sheet with typed or hand written notes and/or code samples.\n",
    "- Questions consist of multiple choice, fill-in-the blank, and short-answer.\n",
    "- If you require a special testing accommodation, you should schedule to take the exam in the CDS testing center as it will be difficult to accommodate exam time extensions in class.\n",
    "- There are no make-up exams. Exam dates are posted on the syllabus, please plan accordingly.\n",
    "- **Exam is issued at the beginning of your Small Group. It will start promptly so arrive on time. You will not get extra time if you arrive late.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## This exam focuses on these lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lesson 07: Files\n",
    "- Lesson 08: Lists\n",
    "    - Specific List methods/functions: sort(), sorted(), remove(), pop(), insert(), append(), len()\n",
    "- Lesson 09: Dictionaries, JSON\n",
    "    - Specific JSON methods: json.load(), json.loads(), json.dump(), json.dumps()\n",
    "    - Specific dict methods: get(), items()\n",
    "- Know how to access composite types such as: `list` of `dict` or `dict` with `lists`. And Know when there are errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Know the concepts, know how they are applied\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will be expected to know the concept: what it is and how that concept is applied in Python code.\n",
    "- Get the conepts from the slides, labs, and assigned readings under **Required Before Large Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept: `File Handle`\n",
    "  - What: a variable that represents access to a file's contents.\n",
    "  - Example: `with open(\"a\",\"r\") as f:` (f is the file handle)\n",
    "- Concept: `Dictionary Key`\n",
    "  - What: a string used to retrieve a value from a dictionary.\n",
    "  - Example \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  c = { 'a' : 1 } # Creates a dictionary with key 'a'\n",
    "  print(c['a'])   # gets the value 1 under the key 'a'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Concept: `Lists are iterable`\n",
    "  - What: The `list` type can be iterated over,:\n",
    "  - Example: \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "      values = [2,2,3,4]\n",
    "      for val in values:\n",
    "          print(val, end = \" \")\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    2 2 3 4\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Concept: `list slice`\n",
    "  - What: `list` types can be sliced like strings.\n",
    "  - Examples: \n",
    "    - `x = [4,3,2,5]`\n",
    "    - `x[1:2] == [3, 2]`\n",
    "- Concept: `dictionaries are iterable`\n",
    "  - What: Using `items()` which return a key/value part for each item in the `dict`\n",
    "  - Examples: \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    d = { \"a\" : 1, \"b\": \"today\", \"c\": 3.4 }\n",
    "    for key, val in d.items():\n",
    "        print(key,\"==\",val)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    a == 1\n",
    "    b == today\n",
    "    c == 3.4\n",
    "    ```\n"
