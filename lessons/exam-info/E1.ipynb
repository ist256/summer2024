    "\n",
    "- Exams are high-stakes, summative assessments. \n",
    "- They measure the individualâ€™s ability to recall, understand, and apply the course material. \n",
    "- They are one of two instruments in this course which measures your mastery of the learning outcomes.\n",
    "- **This exam 1 of 4**\n",
    "- All exams together total 90 points of the 256 that make up your grade in the course ~ 35% of your grade.\n",
    "- **You will have 25 minutes to complete 23 exam questions**.\n",
    "- Exam will be on paper: you will not need a computer to complete the exam.\n",
    "- Each exam focuses on specific lessons, but due to the nature of the course material, all exams are cumulative.\n",
    "- Exams are closed book. No use of notes, Jupyterhub, or any outside resources.\n",
    "- Students can bring a one page cheat sheet with typed or hand written notes and/or code samples.\n",
    "- Questions consist of multiple choice, fill-in-the blank, and short-answer.\n",
    "- If you require a special testing accommodation, you should schedule to take the exam in the CDS testing center as it will be difficult to accommodate exam time extensions in class.\n",
    "- There are no make-up exams. Exam dates are posted on the syllabus, please plan accordingly.\n",
