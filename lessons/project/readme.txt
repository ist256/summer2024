All of your project related datasets will go in this folder. Here are some instructions to help you get started. You will see a Nosky_Sample in here that is for class demonstrations only. Read the Project Overview and Lines of Code Requirements in our Syllabus. 

The Big Picture

You will select a dataset of your interest and through your analysis you will tell a story about what you learned from that data through the use of Python. For a quick look at what we're talking about here, read the NYTimes article GunViolence.pdf. From that you may be able to search out the data they used. Unfortunately the data is no longer accessible (aka downloadable)) to others. And they actually collected data from numerous locations, analyzed the data, and they using the visualizations you see, told the story. You will do the same, using all of the skills you learned in this course.  I saw a very similar data focused story like this in The Athletic which compared the pay of running backs in the NFL over the past 30 years. 


How will your Project be Graded  (play with the Example ParkMagic project). This was an A+ level project. They are few and far between

What makes this an "A+ Level" grade?
    Uses what we learned in units 09-13: pandas, input and display widgets, visualizizations like maps / graphs, maybe api 
    Dataset is enriched in several ways:
        geocode address to lat/lon
        haversine distance for nearby tickets
        day of week and time of day extracted from date and time
    I used something I had to figure out on my own (haversine)
Code:
    Clearly documented, labeled, all AI code is clearly identified.
    Modularized into functions like mark_tickets_nearby(), and get_day_of_week()
    Tests written for functions
    Meets minimum line number requirements.
    Any code that does something questionable is commented for clarity.
Data Exploration
    There is code that explores the data to figure out what kind of story I want to tell and why
    Visuals such as charts, graphs, etc. were used to see what is happening with the data.
Data Product
    There is code that tells the story and allows a user to interact with the data product.
    There is a completed problem analysis with inputs -> process -> output for the data product to explain how the story
        goes.
    It had a video telling the data story + a reflection video
    All phases were done on time and complete. 
    
Grading Considerations
    Degree of independence: This is your final project and an opportunity to show me what you learned in the course. 
        So it is important that you work on your own and if you have to come to me for help we will start by reviewing 
        what you did to solve the problem independently. Have you researched error messages, tried other techniques, 
        traced through your code to find where errors are occuring, etc. 
    Size of the dataset you select. Too small a dataset will not allow much of a story.
    Use of first or alternate dataset identified in Phase 1. Not doing so is often an indicator that not enough time
        was spent at the front end of the project. 
    All work submitted on time and done to completion. For example, not doing  a thorough data dictionary in Phase 1 
        works against you when final grades are assigned. Any late work is also a problem and late work is not reviewed 
        by me on cycle so you will not get timely feedback.
    The size and complexity of your project.... it should be evident that this is a project not a weekly homework.
    In P2, you will do some initial analysis of your dataset. Each analysis asks you to TELL ME, what the analysis 
        shows you. So lets say I did an average of all class exam grades compared to my Spring sections. The analysis
        probably tell me something like "Students in the Summer score higher on Exams 1 and 2 but lower on 3 and 4." as
        opposed to "The average command tells me the average of spring exam scores versus Summer exam scores. I know 
        what average does.... but what does it tell you about the data.
    In P3, write your code using the approaches / techniques that were taught in the course. The point of the project
        is to gauge what you've learned, not what you can dig up on the internet.
    Avoid Academic Integrity Problems: If you DO dig up code from the internet or use AI, cite it (where did you get 
        it from) and explain it (how does it work). Code from the internet is not your code, and if you cannot 
        explain it correctly it will not count towards your lines of code at best, or be a form of plagiarism at worst.
    P3 has a detailed problem analysis with input->process->output just as we have done for 12 weeks. 
    In P4, the video reflection provides you the opportunity to add commentary to the work you submitted. Video
        reflections can help your grade, especially when you use course concepts in your vocabulary, "I had to 
        concatenate several data frames together to build what I wanted," for example. What goes into a good 
        reflection? Anticipate questions we will have of your work, then answer them. Explain your approaches, 
        justify your decisions. Are you happy with your work? What would you do differently? Self-awareness of 
        one's own work is paramount to a good reflection.
