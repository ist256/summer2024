    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will enhance the End-To-End Example from this unit. The EETE loads 6 months of UFO reports and then allows the user to search the reports by State or Shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from that example, we created two functions `read_ufo_data()` which read the dataframes and concatenated them with `pd.concat()` we also wrote a function called `dedupe_series()` which take the input `pd.Series` and returns a list of unique values for creating a drop-down widget. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we created a interact UI where the user can select a State, UFO shape or both, then query the data, outputting a dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Additions to the EETE\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add two additional search criteria to this program: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search by Day of the Week e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...\n",
    "2. Search by Color: Red, Green, White, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases we will need to engineer these two `pd.Series`, let's call them `DayOfWeek` and `Color`. The approach to engineering them will be the same used in the `df.apply(lambda row:)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final program will allow a user to select a Day of the week, UFO Color, UFO Shape, State, or any combinations thereof, and then output the matching rows in a dataframe.\n",
