    "# Homework: Professor Charles Xavier's Teaching Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Charles Xavier has asked us to write a program to automatically calculate a final letter grade and grade points on a 4.0 scale forhis course based on an input point range. Here is the grading scale he uses: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Point Range Grade Grade Points\n",
    "    125-150     A     4.0\n",
    "    100-124     B     3.0\n",
    "    75-99       C     2.0\n",
    "    50-74       D     1.0\n",
    "    0-49        F     0.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "Write a Python program to input a number of points earned and then outputs the letter grade and grade points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when 105 is the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Professor Xavier's Grade Calculator\n",
    "    Input the total points earned 0 to 150: 105\n",
    "    Grade: B Grade Points: 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, when 50 is the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Professor Xavier's Grade Calculator\n",
    "    Input the total points earned 0 to 150: 50\n",
    "    Grade: D Grade Points: 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: You should store the grade and grade points in *variables*. **Do Not** `print()` each case explicitly! Input => Process => Output means we should not put input or output in our process!\n",
    "\n",
    "GOOD: `print(f\"Grade: {grade}...\")`   \n",
    "BAD:  `print(\"Grade: A...\")`  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Handling Bad Input\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should handle bad input. Specifically, there are two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your code should perform bounds checking of the input.  Valid inputs are in the range 0 to 150. Invalid inputs might be -1000 or 200, for exampl.e\n",
    "2. Your code should handle non-integer input. Invalid inputs might 4.5 or \"fifty\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when 500 is the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Professor Xavier's Grade Calculator\n",
    "    Input the total points earned 0 to 150: 500\n",
    "    Error: 500 is not in the range 0 to 150.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, when huge is the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Professor Xavier's Grade Calculator\n",
    "    Input the total points earned 0 to 150: huge\n",
    "    Error: input is not a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **problem simplification** approach as learned in small group and the lab. First we solve a simpler problem, then we will solve the complete problem. There in this assignment you will write THREE programs!\n",
    "\n",
    "- First in You Code 2.1 we will calculate the grade assuming the point range is a number between 0 and 150.\n",
    "- Second in You Code 2.2 we re-write 2.1 to handle numbers outside the range 0 and 150\n",
    "- Finally in You Code 2.3 we re-write 2.2 to handle bad inputs that are not numbers.\n"
