    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* has contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of 1 gallon paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the length of the room in feet, \n",
    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",
    "- the height of the room in feet,\n",
    "- number of coats of paint (how many times will you go over the walls? 1, 2, 3, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted (sum of each of the 4 walls, multiplied by the height of the room)\n",
