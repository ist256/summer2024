    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a program similar to this unit's End-To-End Example. Instead of European countries this program will provide a drop-down of US states. When a state is selected, the program should display the US senators for that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "What information Should you display? Here is a sample of the 2 senators from the State of `NY`:\n",

    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is broken up into parts. We will use problem simplification to solve this problem and take a bottom up approach, making the components, then assembling them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Code 2.1** Copy the `deserialize_json(0` function from small group. In this part you will write tests.\n",
    "- **You Code 2.2** Write a `dedupe_states()` function deduplicate states from the deserialized JSON. \n",
    "- **You Code 2.3** Write a text-only version of the program. input a state, show senators form that state.\n",
    "- **You Code 2.4** Write an interact versio of the program: dropdown list to select a state, then display senator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are taking a bottom up approach, **hold off on completing part 1, until you are on step 2.3**\n",
    "\n",
    "### This Code will fetch the current US Senators from the web and save the results to a `US-Senators.json` file.\n",
