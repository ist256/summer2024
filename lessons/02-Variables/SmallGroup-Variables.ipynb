    "Things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One box of flooring covers 24.5 square feet. \n",
    "- You should account for 10% waste in any project. This means you should buy 10% more flooring than you need.\n",

    "- The area of the room in square feet\n",
    "- The project area when accounting for an additional 10% waste\n",
    "- The number of boxes of flooring required, rounded up to the nearest whole box (since we can only purchase complete boxes). \n",
