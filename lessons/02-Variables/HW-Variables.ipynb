    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* has contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of 1 gallon paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the length of the room in feet, \n",
    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",
    "- the height of the room in feet,\n",
    "- number of coats of paint (how many times will you go over the walls? 1, 2, 3, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted (sum of each of the 4 walls, multiplied by the height of the room)\n",
    "- the number of gallons required to paint the room with the number of coats of paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter length of room: 12\n",
    "Enter width of room: 14\n",
    "Enter height of room: 8\n",
    "Enter number of coats: 2\n",
    "Total area to be painted: 416.00 sqft\n",
    "2 Coats requires: 832.00 sqft\n",
    "1 Can of paint covers 400 sqft\n",
    "Total gallons of paint requried for 2 coats is : 3 cans\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter length of room: 2\n",
    "Enter width of room: 4\n",
    "Enter height of room: 10\n",
    "Enter number of coats: 3\n",
    "Total area to be painted: 120.00 sqft\n",
    "3 Coats requires: 360.00 sqft\n",
    "1 Can of paint covers 400 sqft\n",
    "Total gallons of paint requried for 3 coats is : 1 cans\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the same problem solving approaches from small group: Understanding the problem by example.\n",
    "- Round up to the nearest whole can of paint.\n",
    "- Code exactly one of the examples then change to accept inputs.\n",
