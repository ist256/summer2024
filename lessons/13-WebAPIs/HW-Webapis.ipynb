    "# Homework: Twitter Sentiment of Airlines\n",

    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a marketing firm and have been tasked with producing a data visualization of what people are saying on Twitter/X about each of the airlines you represent. Your firm represents 4 airlines: Gamma Airlines, JetBrown, Murcia Airways, and Untied Airlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data engineer has extracted the \"tweets\" (as you might have guessed by now... its 100% made up) from the X API. You can find the tweets in `airline_tweets.csv`, along with who tweeted it and which airline they tweeted about in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to perform a **sentiment analysis** on each tweet to determine if the message is `positive`, `neutral` or `negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final product should allow the user to select an airline from a drop-down (or choose `*ANY*`) and then a bar chart of user / sentiment counts. Here's a screenshot with all airlines included.\n",

    "## The Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of this code has been written for you. The `extract_sentiment()` and `dedupe_series()` functions are included here. They were written in previous assignments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What you need to figure out:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Code 2.1** Data Preparation. Use `pd.apply()` to create a new series `df['sentiment']` which represents the sentiment of each tweet. Generate a `df['count']` column. Then write the dataframe to the file `airline_tweets_sentiment.csv` **This is important** if you keep calling the API, you will run out of credits, so once you figure out the sentiment, **never do it again!**. This is common practice in web API consumption and you should be adopting it for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Code 2.2** Data Product. Put it all together to read from ``airline_tweets_sentiment.csv`, build a dropdown of airlines, and then create the interact and barchart. The problem analysis should be for this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: The solution to this assignment consists of a whopping 12 lines of code.** Its more about putting the pieces together at this point than anything else.\n"
